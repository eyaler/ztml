# Todo


### Usability

[ ] Better support and benchmarks for non-English texts

[ ] Example for image compression use case

[ ] Expose more parameters and allow skipping steps in CLI / ztml(), via arguments or config file

[ ] Provide pure JS libraries where relevant

[ ] Online GUI

[ ] Validation testing for Safari

[ ] Fix slow rendering with Selenium in validation

### Compression

[ ] Ablation benchmarks

[ ] Improve JS MTF decoding times for large files

[ ] Benchmark alternatives to MTF

[ ] Run length encoding after MTF

[ ] Respect-caps mode using a next-letter-invert-caps-symbol (either on top of the auto-caps when that is viable or forced, or stand-alone)

[ ] Dictionary compression for long texts

[ ] [Fast Huffman one-shift decoder](https://researchgate.net/publication/3159499_On_the_implementation_of_minimum_redundancy_prefix_codes)

[ ] Save (e.g. Huffman) metadata in image / in png metadata

[ ] [Base139](https://github.com/kevinAlbs/Base122/issues/3#issuecomment-263787763)

[ ] Compress the JS itself and use eval

[ ] Strip whitespace from scripts lines not part of multi-line content strings
